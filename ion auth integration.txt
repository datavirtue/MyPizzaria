Ion Auth

You will need to change some of the controller code to support your user registration requirements.
The field validation and additional_data will have to be populated. 
Ion Auth is not a system that can drop into a project and just run, you will have to hack on it.

All of the trigger_events() calls sprinkled throughout the project are not doing anything. 
You have to set the events that match the trigger_events() calls with set_hook().
trigger_events() doesn't take aruments. The only argument is specified in set_hook(). WTF?
Result: not using trigger_events()!
